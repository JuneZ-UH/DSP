# Courses.ICS

Welcome to Courses.ICS, a service of the [Department of Information and Computer Sciences](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu) at the [University of Hawaii at Manoa](http://manoa.hawaii.edu).

### Purpose

This site supports:

  * Students who wish to refresh their understanding of material they learned in previous courses.
  
  * Faculty who wish to provide links to material from prerequisite courses for which they will assume student familiarity.
  
  * Students and faculty who wish to determine how the ICS curriculum aligns with community standards, such as the ACM's [Computer Science Curricula 2013](https://www.acm.org/education/CS2013-final-report.pdf). 
  
  * Students and faculty who come across new online resources for curriculum material and wish to share it with others. 


### Contents

This site contains:

  * [Review Sites]({{ site.baseurl }}/review-sites) provides links to "archival reference versions" of selected ICS courses.  Each review site provides access to self-study materials selected from recent versions of the course. Currently, only a subset of ICS courses have a corresponding review site, but our ultimate goal is to cover all courses in the ICS curriculum.

  * [Syllabuses]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabuses) provides links to syllabuses for undergraduate courses.
  
  * [Course Network]({{ site.baseurl }}/course-network) provides a high-level graphical representation of the structure of the ICS curriculum. 
  
  * [Module Browser]({{ site.baseurl }}/module-browser) provides a detailed representation of ICS courses at the module-level and dependencies between courses at the module level.  Only ICS courses with Review Sites are included in this representation. 
    
  * [Suggestion Box]({{ site.baseurl }}/suggestion-box) provides a way for you to participate in the development of this site.  Want to suggest materials for inclusion in a review site? Flag an error in a module?  Use the Suggestion Box to make your improvements known to the site administrators.
