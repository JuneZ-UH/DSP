# 8. What's next?

All of the Data Science Fellows will assist in the development of a workshop. Today, we've introduced you to two important facets of workshop development:

1. How to design a workshop. What are the characteristics of a high quality workshop?  These characteristics are summarized in [Workshop Design Checklist](https://morea-framework.github.io/docs/change-hi/workshop-design-checklist)

2. How to implement a workshop in the Change-HI site using the Morea framework. More details about implementation are available in [Change-HI Workshop Design Guide](https://morea-framework.github.io/docs/category/change-hi).

We encourage you to approach your workshop development activity in the following way:

1.  Pick a workshop (you will be given a chance to indicate your preferences in a couple of minutes).

2. Meet with the faculty advisor about the workshop at least three weeks prior to the workshop date. Develop a plan for its design and implementation.

3. If the workshop has been held before, then: (a) review the assessment results for that workshop, and (b) review the current workshop design for conformance to the Workshop Design Checklist.

4. Implement (or improve the implementation) of your chosen workshop, attempting to conform to the Workshop Design Checklist whenever possible.

5. Submit your first Pull Request at least one week prior to the workshop date, so that your workshop can be reviewed and any issues found can be resolved prior to holding the workshop.
