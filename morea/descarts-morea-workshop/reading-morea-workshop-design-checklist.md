## Morea Reference Guide

This workshop introduces you to the design of workshops and their implementation using the Morea Framework. 

During the workshop, we teach you "just enough" about Morea to give you a sense for the development process. 

However, once you start working on a real workshop (as opposed to a fake workshop like Best Recipe Ever), you will need to acquire a few more skills, which might include:

* How to add, subtract, and re-order readings and experiences.
* How to add admonitions
* How to create problems with "hidden" solutions that can be displayed by toggling.
* How to revise and resubmit your pull request after receiving feedback.

To help you learn how to do these things, you should consult the [Morea Framework Change-HI documentation](https://morea-framework.github.io/docs/category/change-hi). 

Of course, you can always also seek guidance from your faculty sponsor or Philip Johnson.
