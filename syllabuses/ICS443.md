 * Students will be able to analyze the runtime and efficiency of parallel algorithms.

**Program Learning Outcomes**

* a. Students can apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline
* b. Students can analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution
* c. Students can design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs
* d. Students can function effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal
* f. Students can communicate effectively with a range of audiences
* h. Students can recognize the need for and an ability to engage in continuing professional development
* i. Students can use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice


**Prerequisites**: 311 with C or better

**Textbook(s)**: Joseph Jaja, Introduction to Parallel Algorithms, Addison Wesley, 1992.

**Grading**: The students will be graded on class participation (20\%), homeworks (40\%), and the final exam (40\%).

**Policies**: Late homework policy: Homeworks are due on Thursday at 1:30pm (the beginning of the lecture). Late homeworks can be emailed to the instructor. Penalty for late homeworks is a letter grade reduction (e.g. from A to B) for within each 24 hours that it is late. For example, submission of homework that deserves a letter grade A will be graded B if submitted between Thursday 1:30pm and Friday 1:30pm; will be graded C if submitted before Saturday 1:30pm; and will be graded D if submitted before Sunday 1:30pm. Extenuating circumstances do arise, therefore, a single homework will be accepted up to 72 hours late without any reduction in grade.
