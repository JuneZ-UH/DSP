# ICS 462: Artificial Intelligence for Games



**Description**: Techniques to stimulate intelligence in video games: movement, pathfinding with A* search, decision/behavior trees, state machines, machine learning, tactics. Extend games with your own AI implementations; experience "shootout" contests for the best AI algorithm/implementation.

**Objectives**: See Learning Outcomes

**Course Learning Outcomes**

* Students will be able to extend an existing game program by adding AI code
* Students will be able to program goal-oriented movement of non-player characters
* Students will be able to write code to find near-optimal paths using A* search and other techniques
* Students will be able to write decision making code utilizing decision trees, state machines, fuzzy logic, production systems, and/or scripts
* Students will understand and apply machine learning algorithms to games
* Students will experience AI program competitions
* Students will be able to successfully present ideas, code, and techniques both individually and as part of a group (Oral focus)
* Students will be able to write descriptive, comparative, and critiquing papers on game AI (Writing Intensive)

**Program Learning Outcomes**

* a. Students can apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline
* b. Students can analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution
* c. Students can design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs
* d. Students can function effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal
* f. Students can communicate effectively with a range of audiences
* i. Students can use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice
