**Description**: Network analysis, architecture, digital signal analysis and design; circuit switching, packet switching, packet broadcasting; protocols and standards; local area networks; satellite networks; ALOHA channels; examples.

**Objectives**: In this course, students will:
* learn about computer networking, focusing on the fundamental design principles of computer networks and protocols.
*  study networks of practical importance, including the Internet, TCP/IP, and wireless networks.
*  learn to write in C computer programs to work with the network, specifically implementing clients, servers, and protocols.

**Course Learning Outcomes**: See objectives.

**Program Learning Outcomes**

* a. Students can apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline
* b. Students can analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution
* c. Students can design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs
* e. Students have an understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilities
* h. Students can recognize the need for and an ability to engage in continuing professional development
* i. Students can use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice
* j. An ability to use and apply current technical concepts and practices in the core information technologies. [BA IT only]
