**Prerequisites**: 141 and 211, or consent.

**Textbook(s)**: Mastering Networks -- An Internet Lab Manual 5.0", by JÃ¶rg Liebeherr and Magda el Zarki, 2004.

**Grading**: Labs (60%)
Quizzes (30%)
Final exam (10%)

**Policies**: Attendance is mandatory (but not graded). In particular, participation in the lab sessions is necessary in order to successfully do the lab reports.

Lab reports are due on time, with a loss of 20% of the points for every day they are late. Quizzes and exams must be taken early or on time, unless there are well-documented extenuating circumstances, in which case the same 20% per day rule will apply (and only if student makes special arrangements with the instructor to take the quiz late).

No food or drinks in the lab.
