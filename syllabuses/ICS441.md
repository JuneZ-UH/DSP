**Description**: Grammars, sequential machines, equivalence, minimalization, analysis and synthesis, regular expressions, computability, unsolvability, GÃ¶del's theorem, Turing machines.

**Objectives**

* Students can write rigorous proofs.
* Students can compose analytical arguments.
* Students can conduct theoretical research on topics in fields of their interests.
* Students can write theoretical papers.

**Course Learning Outcomes**: See objectives.

**Program Learning Outcomes**

* a. Students can apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline
* b. Students can analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution


**Prerequisites**: 311 or consent

**Textbook(s)**: "Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation," John E. Hopcroft and Jeffrey D. Ullman

**Grading**: A few assignments (100%) in which students have to solve given theoretical problems and write technical reports on their solutions to the given problems, where the last assignment is the take-home final exam
