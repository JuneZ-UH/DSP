# ICS 312: Machine-Level and Systems Programming



**Description**: Machine organization, machine instructions, addressing modes, assembler language, subroutine linkage, linking to higher-level languages, interface to operating systems, introduction to assemblers, loaders and compilers. Pre: 212 (or concurrent), or consent.

**Objectives**

* Students understand the underlying principle behind machine-level data representations, computing, and programming
* Students are proficient with assembly programming for the x86 architecture, including register operations, control structures, bitwise operations, and subprograms
* Students understand the underlying principles behind compiling, linking, loading, and debugging
* Students gain some hands-on experience with developing a small compiler

**Course Learning Outcomes**: (See objectives.)

**Program Learning Outcomes**

* a. Students can apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline
* b. Students can analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution
* c. Students can design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs
* i. Students can use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice
