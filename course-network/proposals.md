# Course network proposals for ICS degree programs

This page contains proposals for changes to the prerequisite and/or course structure for the ICS program.


### A curriculum designed around a "common core" of 111, 211, 311 and 141, 241, 341

The following network illustrates the following changes:

   * ICS 311 is renamed to ICS 341
   * ICS 314 is renamed to ICS 311
   * ICS 315 (Programming for the web) is eliminated because the new 311 covers that material.
   * All 3xx courses (other than 311 and 341) depend upon 311 and 341.
   * All 4xx courses either depend upon a 3xx course that is not 311 or 341 (and thus implicitly depend upon them) or else depend upon 311 and 341.
   * The network diagram corresponds to semesters: all courses can be taken within 5 semesters of starting the program. Enough courses to graduate can be taken within 4 semesters of starting the program.
